                Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) stated: “A man is not a believer who fills his stomach while his neighbour is
                hungry.” This means that you are not a true Muslim or believer in Allah (SWT) if you fail to give to
                charity
                and show mercy to someone who is less fortunate than you.

                Allah states in the Quran that giving in charity, whether big or small, will increase your wealth and
                righteousness.

                “Who will lend Allah a good loan so that he can increase it many times?” (Quran 2:245).

                Charity is mentioned dozens of times in the Quran.
                <br>
                "Worship none but Allah. treat with kindness
                your parents and kindred, and orphans and those in need;
                <br>
                speak fair to the people; be steadfast in
                prayer; and practice regular charity" (Surah Al-Baqarah:83).
